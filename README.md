Troubled Waters - Video Game Dev University, Second Semester Project.

Code and art and story by Me (Alejandro Thomas Lawler)

Incarnate a migthy pirate searching the treasure at the end of a misterious map. 

Troubled Waters is a bullet-hell like game where you control a pirate ship in the middle of the sea while hordes of angry sharks and pirates try to destroy you.
Kill, survive and discover the secret behind the map.

The idea behind this proyect was to apply basic to intermediate programing skills and unity tools. 
I kinda went out of my way and I implemented a random spawner generator based on your position and a few area arround the map. 
Wanted to do a skill tree section to improve your ship but ended up doing a simple repair ship button that saves your health throught the scenes, because I didnt have enough time and tools to do it.

WASD to move.

Automatic attack to nearest target.
